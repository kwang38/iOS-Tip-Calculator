## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Notes

One of the biggest hurdles when it came to completing this project was familiarizing myself with Xcode. It was not only challenging to navigate through it, but also offered a variety of options, which sometimes made it difficult to figure out what I need to do in order to accomplish a task.
